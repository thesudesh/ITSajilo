                <strong>Laboratory Works:</strong><br>
                This course can be learnt in effective way only if we give focus is given in practical aspects of algorithms and techniques discussed in class. Therefore student should be able to implement the algorithms and analyze their behavior.

                For the laboratory work, students should implement the following algorithms in C/ C++ and perform their analysis for time and space complexity.
                
                Basic iterative algorithms GCD algorithm, Fibonacci Sequences, Sequential and Binary Search.
                Basic iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
                Binary Search with Divide and conquer approach.
                Merge Sort, Heap sort, Quick Sort, Randomized Quick Sort.
                Selection Problem with divide and Conquer approach
                Fractional Knapsack Problem, Job sequencing with deadline, Kruskal’s algorithm, Prims algorithm, Dijkstra’s Algorithm
                Implement the dynamic programming algorithms.
                Algorithms using Backtracking approach.
                Implement approximation Algorithm.
