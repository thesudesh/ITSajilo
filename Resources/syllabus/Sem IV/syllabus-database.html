   <p><b>Course Description:</b>  The course covers the basic concepts of databases, database system 
    concepts and architecture, data modeling using ER diagram, relational model, SQL, relational 
    algebra and calculus, normalization, transaction processing, concurrency control, and database 
    recovery.</p>
