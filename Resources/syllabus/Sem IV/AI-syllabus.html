   <p><b>Course Description:</b>   The course introduces the ideas and techniques underlying the principles 
    and design of artificial intelligent systems. The course covers the basics and applications of AI, 
    including: design of intelligent agents, problem solving, searching, knowledge representation 
    systems, probabilistic reasoning, neural networks, machine learning and natural language 
    processing.</p>
    <p><b>Course Objective:</b> The main objective of the course is to introduce fundamental concepts of
        Artificial Intelligence. The general objectives are to learn about computer systems that exhibit 
        intelligent behavior, design intelligent agents, identify AI problems and solve the problems, 
        design knowledge representation and expert systems, design neural networks for solving 
        problems, identify different machine learning paradigms and identify their practical applications.</p>
