                        In the practical session, students will learn to use project management, CASE, and modeling
                        tools. They also prepare a project report that includes at least analysis, design, and
                        implementation phases of system analysis and design. The project can be done in groups with at
                        most four members in each group using any suitable database, programming, and interfacing
                        technologies.                    </p>
