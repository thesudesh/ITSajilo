                    Course Description:
                </b> 
                This course presents a study of Finite State Machines and their languages. It covers the details of finite state automata, regular expressions, context free grammars.  More, the course includes design of the Push-down automata and Turing Machines.  The course also includes basics of undecidabilty and intractability.                </p>

                    Course Objectives:    
                </b> 
                The main objective of the course is to introduce concepts of the models of computation and formal language approach to computation.  The general objectives are to, introduce concepts in automata theory and theory of computation, design different finite state machines and grammars and recognizers for different formal languages, identify different formal language classes and their relationships, and determine the decidability and intractability of computational problems.                </p>

                        Student should write programs and prepare lab sheets for most of the units in the syllabus. Majorly, students should practice design and implementation of Finite State Machines viz. DFA, NFA, PDA, and Turing Machine. Students are highly recommended to construct Tokenizers/ Lexical analyzer over/for some language. The nature of programming can be decided by the instructor and students as per their comfort. The instructors have to prepare lab sheets for individual unit covering the concept of all units as per the requirement. The sample lab sessions can be as following descriptions;                    </p>
