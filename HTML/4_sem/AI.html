                </b> 
                The course introduces the ideas and techniques underlying the principles and

                design of artificial intelligent systems. The course covers the basics and applications of AI
                
                including: design of intelligent agents, problem solving, searching, knowledge representation
                
                systems, probabilistic reasoning, neural networks, machine learning and natural language

                The main objective of the course is to introduce concepts of Artificial

                Intelligence. The general objectives are to learn about computer systems that exhibit intelligent
                
                behavior, design intelligent agents, identify AI problems and solve the problems, design knowledge
                
                representation and expert systems, design neural networks for solving problems, identify different
                
                machine learning paradigms and identify their practical applications.

                        Student should write programs and prepare lab sheet for most of the units in the syllabus. Majorly,

                        students should practice design and implementation of intelligent agents and expert systems,
                        
                        searching techniques, knowledge representation systems and machine learning techniques. Students
                        
                        are also advised to implement Neural Networks for solving practical problems of AI. Students are
                        
                        advised to use LISP, PROLOG, and any other high level language like C, C++, Java, etc. The
                        
                        nature of programming can be decided by the instructor and student as per their comfort. The
                        
                        instructors have to prepare lab sheets for individual units covering the concept of the units as per the
