                    Course Description:
                </b> 
                This course includes concepts of instruction set architecture,
                organization or micro-architecture, and system architecture. The instruction set architecture
                includes programmer’s abstraction of computer. The micro-architecture consist internal
                representation of computers at register and functional unit level. The system architecture
                includes organization of computers at the cache and bus level.                </p>

                <p><b> 
                    Course Objectives:    
                </b> 
                Representation of data and algorithms used to perform operations on data
                Demonstrate different operations in terms of Micro-operations
                Explain architecture of basic computer and micro-programmed control unit
                Understand and memory and I/O organization of a typical computer system
                Demonstrate benefits of pipelined systems                </p>
